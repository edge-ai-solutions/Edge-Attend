Title - Secure and Efficient Attendance Management with Edge AI Face Detection

Language Used: - Kotlin with Jetpack Compose

Technology Used: - Tensorflow lite Face recognition

Core Technology:

Edge AI Face Detection: A pre-trained deep learning model embedded directly on the tablet or phone camera performs real-time face detection. This eliminates the need for constant internet connection and ensures data privacy as facial recognition calculations occur locally on the device.
Facial Recognition (Optional): For enhanced security, especially in high-security areas, facial recognition can be integrated as a secondary layer. This requires a pre-enrolled database of authorized personnel's faces and compares them to detected faces in real-time.


Use Cases:

1.Schools:
Benefits:
		Streamline student attendance recording, eliminating manual processes and paper logs.
		Improve accuracy and reduce errors in attendance data.
		Enhance school security by identifying unauthorized individuals entering the premises.
Implementation:
		Teachers or designated staff use tablets or phones equipped with the app to scan students' faces as they enter the classroom.
		The app automatically marks attendance and timestamps for each student, syncing with a secure local database.
		For enhanced security, facial recognition can be used to verify student identities against a pre-enrolled database.


2.Building Entrance:

Benefits:
		Offer a contactless and user-friendly access control system.
		Improve building security by identifying and granting access to authorized personnel only.
		Maintain a record of employee entry and exit times.

Implementation:
		Mounted tablets or phone kiosks at building entrances utilize face detection to identify authorized personnel.
		Upon successful identification, the system unlocks the door, granting access.
		Attendance data and timestamps are automatically logged for record-keeping purposes.

3.Factory Entrance:

Benefits:
		Track employee attendance efficiently at factory entrances.
		Improve security by monitoring authorized personnel entering restricted areas.
		Reduce time spent on manual attendance tracking tasks.

Implementation:
		The system operates similarly to building entrances, with tablets or phone kiosks at factory entry points.
		Face detection identifies authorized workers and grants access to designated areas.
		Attendance data is automatically logged, simplifying payroll management.


4.High-Security Areas:

Benefits:
		Provides an additional layer of security for sensitive areas.
		Verifies authorized personnel through a combination of face detection and facial recognition.
		Maintains a detailed record of access attempts for audit purposes.

Implementation:
		This scenario utilizes both face detection and facial recognition.
		Upon entry attempts, the system first performs face detection.
		Identified individuals are then compared to a pre-enrolled database for facial recognition verification.
		Only authorized personnel with a successful facial recognition match are granted access.

Platform Features:
		Offline Functionality: The app operates entirely on the device, eliminating reliance on internet connectivity.
		Secure Data Storage: Facial recognition data (if used) is securely stored locally on the device with robust encryption.
		Centralized Management: A central server manages user enrollment, access control settings, and data synchronization across devices (optional for offline deployments).
		Detailed Reports: Generate comprehensive reports on attendance data, including timestamps and access logs.

Benefits:
		1.Improved Efficiency: Streamlines attendance recording and access control processes.
		
		2.Enhanced Security: Provides secure access control and identification, especially in high-security areas.
		
		3.Offline Functionality: Works seamlessly even in areas with limited or no internet connection.
		
		4.Privacy-Focused: Edge AI processing ensures user data privacy by keeping facial recognition calculations local (if applicable).
		
		5.Scalability: The platform can be easily scaled to accommodate different sized organizations and locations.

This AI-powered face detection platform offers a versatile and secure solution for attendance management and access control across various scenarios. By leveraging Edge AI technology, it provides a reliable and efficient way to manage personnel movement while maintaining data privacy and security.
